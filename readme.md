# Virtual Tourist

An application that let you travel virtually to any place in the world with the help of the Flickr API. The idea is that you drop a pin to any location in the map and the app will let you view images from each location. The app will show a progress bar while it is downloading your photos on the collection view, if you want to see more pictures you can use the "New Collection" button. The app will remember the places where you dropped a pin on a previous trip.

The goal of this Application is to work deeper with Core Data exploring the Data stack model. As an addition start looking on how to do more with NSOperations to make the app run faster and smoother.
